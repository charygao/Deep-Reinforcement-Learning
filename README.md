# Deep Reinforcement Learning Project by Charles Xu

## Introduction

This project is aiming at:

- Recurring Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms with the most concise python code.
- Implement a most simple DRL lib for commonly usage.

## Features

- Full deep reinforcement learning structure in a single file
- One-to-one correspondence with the structure and naming in the paper
- Most simplified coding
